1. Introduction
=================

This is my first game realized by Html5's canvas. The idea of the game is collected from chicken invader, star war and battlefield.


* Testing tool: karma and jasmine.
* Building tool: grunt.
* Url to play: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2062352/BattleOfArtillery/public_html/index.html.

My propose when creating this is to  learn more about the structure to design and program a game. As a result, I don't use any library here.
