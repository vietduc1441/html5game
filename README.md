1. Introduction
=================

This is my first game realized by Html5's canvas. The idea of the game is collected from chicken invader, star war and battlefield.


* Testing tool: karma and jasmine.
* Building tool: grunt.
* Url to play: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2062352/BattleOfArtillery/public_html/index.html.

My propose when creating this is to  learn more about the structure to design and program a game. As a result, I don't use any library here.


2. Gameplay
==================
* You, as a gunner at the bottom of the screen, have to oppose enemies at the top.
* You could control you aim by move the mouse.
* If you don't fire, the enemies does not fire at you.
* If you fire, they will fire back exactly at  your position even if you don't fire correctly or not.
* An enemy will be destroyed if hitted 10 times.
* To avoid bullets from enemies, you have to move swiftly after you fire.
